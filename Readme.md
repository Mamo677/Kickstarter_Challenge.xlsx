# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
the purpose  is to organized the data from unstructerd into structerd
 filter the data,sort the data visualize the data and use it for the final report


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
How i performed to get my anaylsis on  "outomes based on launch date" was by creating a new column called 'YEAR'. i changed the row labels to months to give me the numbers that were in that month. i used a parent category to Theater that way i can be all in one subject. the reason why i did this so that the numbers can be shown for each month what was successful, failed, and canceled. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 the way i performed my anaylsis is by creating a new sheet. then i Named it "Outcome based on goals". on the new sheet, i created 8 new columns. i gave them all names which were Goal, Number successful, Number failed, number canceled, total projects, precentage Successful, precentage failed, and precentage canceled. 
in the goal column, i put in the numbers from less than 1000 to greater than 50,000. for the code that i used to put in the number successful, number failed, and number canceled, i used 'COUNTIFS' statement. For the Total Project i used 'SUM' statement. For precentage of each successful, failed, and canceled,  i Used 'ROUND' formula. The chart that i used to show the " Outcome based on goal" was a line chart. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Every time when i did copy and paste i  can't find the original file foder path.
 formula error Codes likes of #Div/0!
 and # VALUE!

## Results


- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
According to the outcomes based on launch date, December had the lowest grand total of 75 , and May had the highest grand total of 166.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  1000 to 4999 number of successful is higher compare to other goals


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Data comes unstructred likes date columns comes with time stamp
column and row space are too tight up

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
   according to project 
   we can use graphs just likes of Bar Chart,Pie chart and so on...
